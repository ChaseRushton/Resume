## üîç Overview

Expert in bioinformatics with a broad understanding of biological sciences, a passion for technology, and a strong ability to apply tech industry best practices to computational biology and data science. I have proven experience collaborating with bioinformaticians and molecular specialists across the hospital network to swiftly transition from analysis proof-of-concept to production-grade analysis pipelines for cancer detection, annotation, and custom database integration. My expertise lies in oncology and next-generation sequencing (NGS), where I excel at building robust, reproducible, and scalable NGS workflows. I possess a high-level knowledge of the current and future state of the growing industry for managing and processing NGS data in CLIA certified labs. Additionally, I have experience in designing and implementing strategies to develop scalable genomics infrastructure (AWS, HPC, IAP). I have executed custom analysis pipelines on read-level data across extensive datasets, including TCGA, GOAL consortium, and UPHS clinical patients, translating the results into actionable insights.
